Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's services. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing revenue loss.

Problem Statement
The telecommunications industry faces a significant challenge in retaining customers due to high competition and low switching costs. This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on historical data, enabling companies to implement targeted retention strategies.

Objectives
Predict Churn Probability: Accurately predict the likelihood of a customer churning within a specific time frame.

Identify Key Factors: Determine the most influential factors contributing to customer churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, or customer service calls).

Enable Proactive Retention: Provide actionable insights to design targeted retention campaigns.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. It includes customer demographics, account information, and service details.

Repository Structure
customer_churn_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.

preprocessed_churn_data.csv: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for model training.

README.md: Description of the project and repository.

Key Steps
Data Exploration: Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and key insights.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized features.

Model Development: Built and evaluated machine learning models to predict customer churn.

Tools and Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
